angular tutorials : 

1. angular js is a library but angular is a framework
2. Developed by google
3. benefits of angular : 1. Speed and performance 2. smaller applications 3. modular applications 4. Use typescript 5. single page applications 6. Cross platform

blocks of angular : 
1. modules : just like a class or container , an angular application has atleast one root module and if there are more than one then they are the featured modules 
2. components : building blocks it usually consist opf multiple parts like ; ts file , templates , testing and css files
3. services : function or objects to perform a specific task
4. directive : to extend the power of HTML attributes and change the appearance and behaviour of DOM Element


PWA : Progressive Web Applications : Just like an app 

TypeScript : Superset of Javascript 
2. Strongly Typed
3. Developed by Microsoft

TypeScript provides Type Safety : 
1. Free from Type Errors 
2. Free from undefined and null values 
3. Types are stripped when converting from Ts to js

package.json : to maintain the dependencies 

package-lock.json : to maintain the exact versions of the dependencies for mainitaining the consistency among the environments

tsc config : maintains the configuration for the project 
target : the version of ecma in which program to compile 
module : in which you want to run your typescript whether it is browser or OS 

single Page Applications : In this everytime new page is not refreshed so making it fast to view 
2. It does not make requests to server for every URL requests

Variable assignment is mandatory in typescript

reduce function in js : to calculate each of the number of array like [10,2,3,4] = 10+2+3+4

enum : just like class 

can use const enum to trim some lines of code basically used in production

tuples : just like Arrays but number of element and each element type is defined in ts

any datatype : it suggests that a particular variable has no specific datatype it can be assigned to any values
be it string or number 

note : try to avoid any as much as possible 

datatypes : string , number , arrays, tuples , any, void , boolean , never , enum
